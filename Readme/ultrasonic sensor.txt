ultrasonic sensor 

Functions:
            digitalWrite(trig,LOW);         // CLEAR THE TRIGERPIN 
            digitalWrite(trig,HIGH);        // SET THE TRIGER PIN ON HIGH STATE FOR 10 MICRO SECONDS
          
            pinMode(echo,INPUT);            // set the echo pin as input

Description:

	This sensor can be used to test ultrasonic sensor measure distance by using ultrasonic waves, in this Instructable we will learn about HC-SR04 widelyknow
	as Ultrasonic Sensor,how it works and how to interface with the NodeMCU.And also how to measure the distance using HC-SR04.The sensor head emits an ultrasonic
	wave and receives the wave reflected back from the target.

	An Ultrasonic sensor is a device that can measure the distance of an object by using sound waves. It measures distance by sending out a sound wave at a specific
	frequency and waits for that sound wave to bounce back.By recording thetime taken between the sound wave being generated and the sound wave bouncing back, it 
	is possible to calculate the distance between the sensor and the object.
