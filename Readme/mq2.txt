Description:

	MQ2 is one of the commonly used gas sensors in MQ sensor series. It is a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) type Gas Sensor also known as Chemiresistors as
	the detection is based upon change of resistance of the sensing material when the Gas comes in contact with the material. Using a simple voltage divider 
	network, concentrations of gas can be detected.

	MQ2 Gas sensor works on 5V DC and draws around 800mW. It can detect LPG, Smoke, Alcohol, Propane, Hydrogen, Methane and Carbon Monoxide concentrations anywhere
	from 200 to 10000ppm.To calibrate the gas sensor you can hold the gas sensor near smoke/gas you want to detect and keep turning the potentiometer until the Red LED
 	on the module starts glowing. Turn the screw clockwise to increase sensitivity or anticlockwise to decrease se
