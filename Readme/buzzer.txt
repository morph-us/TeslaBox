Working:

	Description:

	There are two types are buzzers that are commonly available. The one shown here is a simple buzzer which when powered will make a ContinuousBeeeeeeppp.... sound,
	the other type is called a readymade buzzer which will look bulkier than this and will produce a Beep. Beep. Beep.Sound due to theinternal oscillating circuit 
	present inside it. 

	This buzzer can be used by simply powering it using a DC power supply ranging from 4V to 9V. A simple 9V battery can also be used, but it is recommended to use a 
	regulated +5V or +6V DC supply. The buzzer is normally associated with a switching circuit to turn ON or turn OFF the buzzer at required time and require interval.
